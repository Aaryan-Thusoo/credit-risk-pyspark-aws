# Credit Risk Early Warning System (PySpark + AWS)

## Business Problem
Build an Early Warning System (EWS) that flags borrowers whose credit risk is
deteriorating, using historical behavior to predict adverse outcomes over a
future horizon (e.g., next 3 months). This supports portfolio monitoring and
risk prioritization.

## Tech Stack
- Python, PySpark (feature engineering + ML)
- AWS S3 (data lake)
- Spark MLlib (baseline models)

## Project Status
In progress — implementing time-window feature engineering and baseline models.
