# Credit Risk Default Prediction (PySpark + AWS)

## Business Problem
This project is looking to predict probability of default for consumer loans to support credit approval and portfolio risk monitoring in a banking context.
The work in this project is done to showcase my skills and knowledge of using Python, PySpark, AWS and Machine Learning to apply in an industry setting

## Architecture
I am using raw loan data stored in Amazon S3 then processed using PySpark for feature
engineering. Further more I am training machine learning models that estimate default risk.

## Tech Stack
- Python, PySpark
- AWS S3
- Spark MLlib

## Project Status
This project is currently under active development.
